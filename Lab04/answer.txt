- Question: Which classes are aggregates of other classes? Checking all constructors of whole classes if they 
initialize for their parts?
- Answer: CompactDisc, Cart, Store, Aims


- Question: When overriding the equals() method of the Object class, you will have to cast the Object 
parameter obj to the type of Object that you are dealing with. For example, in the Media class, you 
must cast the Object obj to a Media, and then check the equality of the two objectsâ€™ attributes as the 
above requirements (i.e. title for Media; title and length for Track). If the passing object is 
not an instance of Media, what happens?
- Answer: If object is not instance of Media, the downcasting will be runtime error. 


- Question: What class should implement the Comparable interface?
- Answer: Media


- Question: In those classes, how should you implement the compareTo() method be to reflect the ordering that we 
want?
- Answer:
    @Override
    public int compare(Media media1, Media media2) {
        int result = Float.compare(media1.getCost(), media2.getCost());
        if (result == 0) {
            return media1.getTitle().compareTo(media2.getTitle());
        }
        return result;
    }


- Question: Can we have two ordering rules of the item (by title then cost and by cost then title) if we use this 
Comparable interface approach?
- Answer: Collections.sort(media, Comparator.comparing(Media::getCost).thenComparing(Media::getTitle));


- Question: Suppose the DVDs has a different ordering rule from the other media types, that is by title, then decreasing 
length, then cost. How would you modify your code to allow this?
- Answer: Collections.sort(dvd,Comparator.comparing(DigitalVideoDisc::getTitle).thenComparing(DigitalVideoDisc::getLength)).thenComparing(DigitalVideoDisc::getCost));
